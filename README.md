# A Simple Game - Float the Ball

Float the Ball is a simple game, the aim of which is to keep the ball floating and not letting it fall down.

### Tech

Float the Ball uses the following technologies to work:

* [Processing 3]
* [Python] - Processing 3 supports a lot of languages
* [Jython] - Processing 3 is built upon Java

### Setup

Processing3 IDE is all you need to run this (not a project yet üòÅ ) and can be used to build it as a Java application.


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

**In fact what exists is just a code base with environment setup. The ultimate aim of this project is not to enhance the game itself but train an RL agent to be able to play this game.**

So, if you are an __AI/ ML__ person, you may wish to contribute the existing branch working on implementing an RL agent.

In the current version, machine plays the game on the basis of a simple algorithm which isn't at all good once the speed of ball becomes higher and that is what the aim of this project is ultimately. Anyways any improvement even in the current algorithm are highly appreciated.

Well, are you more interested in the appearance of __interface__ and want to improve it? So, what are you waiting for, there are tons of features awaiting you, including getting up the scoreboard on screen.
```
Advise: Make sure any significant contributions that include a new feature and donot fit the 
current architecture should be implemented as a class module and imported in the required 
existing file.
